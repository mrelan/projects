# USDA-APHIS Project 2020

This project was done toidentify farms selling poultry and eggs in Delaware,
Maryland, and Virginia using publicly available online data. 
New methods to detect registered and unregistered farms selling poultry and egg products and
regional trends were generated. These methods will aid in identifying geographical areas prone to infection as
well as the outreach of information.

Deliverables:
1. An application with interactive maps showing farms selling poultry and egg products
from online registries and Google Places: The online application can provide information
about farms within a user-identified radius of a latitude and longitude centroid. A
temporary version of this application can be found at
https://umdfire-aphis.shinyapps.io/farmsapp/. In order to access the website, you need
to be invited and create a ShinyApps.io account. Instructions on how to run the application offline in a local computer and how to deploy the online application can be
found in the README.txt file in the “1. APP” folder submitted together with this report.
2. Spreadsheets with address and contact information of farms selling poultry and egg
products from federal, state, online directories and Google Places. These spreadsheets
can be found in the “2. SPREADSHEETS” folder submitted together with this report.
3. A report that outlines methodology, best practices, and results from scraping data from
online forums, public registries, Google Places, and Google Trends. This can be found in
the “3. REPORT” folder.
4. A folder of codes in R that allows all results to be replicated. All the codes and
accompanying flowcharts can be found in the “4. CODES” folder.
