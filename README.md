# Chatbot in python
This python project generates a chatbot using deep learning techniques.
The chatbot is trained on a dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. A special recurrent neural 
network (LSTM) is used to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and generate a random response from the list of responses.
This is a screenshot to demonstrate how the chatbot works:
